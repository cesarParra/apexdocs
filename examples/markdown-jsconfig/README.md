# Markdown with JS Config Example

This project contains an example for generating simple markdown documentation.

It has no integrations with a Static Site Generator (SSG) or any other tool.

The configuration is powered by a JavaScript file, `apexdocs.config.js`. In it you will
find it uses a few of the configuration hooks that are available, which allow you to customize
the output of the documentation.
