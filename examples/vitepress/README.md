# Vitepress Example

This project contains an example on how to generate documentation to be rendered with [Vitepress](https://vitepress.dev/).

## Getting Started

* Follow the Vitepress installation instructions [here](https://vitepress.dev/guide/getting-started#installation).
* Keep track of where you initialized your VitePress config. If it is different than the `docs` directory, you will
need to make sure that it matches the `targetDir` when configuring ApexDocs.

## Configuration

Take a look at the `apexdocs.config.ts` file to see how the configuration is set up.

Pay special attention to the following:

* `transformReference` -> This updates the reference links generated by ApexDocs to the preferred format for Vitepress.

This is **not** required, but Vitepress says in their documentation that they prefer when the links do not contain the .md extension.

* `transformReferenceGuide` -> This ensures that the `index` file always contains the correct frontmatter that Vitpress expects.

* `transformDocs` -> We use this hook to create a `sidebar` file that Vitepress uses to generate the sidebar navigation.

* `transformDocPage` -> This updates each individual page's frontmatter so that it has the correct title.
